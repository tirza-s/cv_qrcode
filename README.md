# QR Code Generator for CV

This is my personal fun project that generates custom QR codes for my CV, using [Segno](https://github.com/heuer/segno) for QR generation and [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) for image processing.  
It includes two versions:
- **Plain QR code** (no logo)
- **QR code with logo embedded**
