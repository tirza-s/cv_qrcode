# QR Code Generator for CV
This is my personal fun project that generates custom QR codes for my CV, using [Segno](https://github.com/heuer/segno) for QR generation and [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) for image processing.  
It includes two versions:
- **Plain QR code** (no logo)
- **QR code with logo embedded**

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation 
I've always been curious about how QR codes work. Of course, there are plenty of free platforms to generate one, but I wanted to build my own.  

The idea came after a job interview where the recruiter asked for my CV, and I didnâ€™t have a printed copy with me.
A personal QR code felt like the perfect solution. Simple to use, easy to share, and a step toward using less paper. Plus, it makes my CV and portfolio feel more modern and interactive.  

I also saw this as a chance to practice creative coding with Python, experimenting with custom colors, error correction, and embedding a logo into the QR code.
